# This is a 'build_env' action hook. This script will be executed inline
# to the custom 'assemble' script and therefore doesn't need to start
# with a '#!' line nor be marked as an executable file. This script will
# be interpreted as if it is a 'bash' script. This script can be used to
# dynamically set additional environment variables required by the build
# process. These might for example be environment variables which
# specify where third party libraries or packages installed from the
# 'pre_build' hook are located and which may be needed when building
# application artefacts. When we source the 'build_env' script, any
# environment variables set by it will be automatically exported.
# Although principally intended for setting environment variables, it
# can include other script logic, but this should be avoided except
# to the extent it is required to work out what to set any environment
# variables to.

# If a cache directory exists, use that to trigger use of a cache
